                 <h2>About Online Payments</h2>
                    <p>Important Note!  Most assessments are due on the 1st day of the month. The Statement periods end on the 15th day of the month. Payments not received and processed by the 15th may incur a late fee. Delinquencies will be reflected in the following month’s Statement.</p>
                    <p>If you are mailing your payment, please be advised that Covid has created considerable delays in mail delivery and check processing times between banks. We recommend using the ACH Debit form, free auto withdrawal of dues payments, to avoid late fees.</p>
                    <p>If you prefer to mail your dues payment, please do so about ten (10) days prior to its due date, which is typically the 1st day of the month.</p>
                    <p><em>CINC | RevoPay – How and When Payments Are Applied:</em> For eCheck payments, CINC/AI processes these payments. If a homeowner submits a payment prior to 2:30 PM EST, the payment is applied to the homeowner’s account with the date of the payment and deposited to the association’s bank account the same business day. If the homeowner submits a payment on a non-business day or after 2:30 PM EST on a business day, the payment is applied to the homeowner’s account with the date of the payment and deposited to the association’s account the next business day.</p>
                    <p>For credit card payments, once a homeowner makes their payment, the payment is applied to the homeowner’s account with the date of the payment. The deposit is made to the association account once the credit card company funds the payment. Homeowners will not be redirected to a separate site to make a payment. Once payment is submitted, the payment is applied to the homeowner’s account with the date of the payment. The deposit is made to the association account once the credit card company funds the payment, which typically takes 1-2 business days.</p>
                    <p>Please contact us if you have questions or require assistance.</p>
