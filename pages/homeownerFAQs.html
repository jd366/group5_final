               <h2>What does ASPM-SanDiego do for my community? </h2>
               <p>Our primary goal is to provide the Board with our expertise and guidance by providing innovative solutions that help improve residents’ quality of life in the community and increase property market values. </p>
               <p>As your Association’s manager, ASPM staff may only act solely at the direction of the HOA’s Board of Directors. The Board makes all HOA business decisions; ASPM is tasked with implementing those decisions and assists the Board in enforcing the HOA’s governing documents. </p> 
               <p><em>Finances.</em> One of our most critical responsibilities is the monthly and annual preparation of balanced and fiscally accurate financial reports. We track and prepare all accounting activities for your Association, including budget planning, accounts receivable, accounts payable, taxes, audits and general ledger preparation, and procure financial investment advice. </p>
               <p><em>Inspections & Vendors.</em> Our focus is on eliminating deferred maintenance, which is the greatest challenge facing HOAs throughout Southern California. We inspect the common areas on a schedule mandated by our contract with the Association. We anticipate needed repair projects, identify scopes of work and procure proposals for these projects.  We supervise the Association’s vendors, contractors  and maintenance services as requested by the Board.  </p> 
               <p><em>Reports & Meetings.</em> We prepare financial, administrative, maintenance, and operational reports, records, and other documents for Board review at Association Meetings.  </p>
               <p><em>Compliance & Legal.</em> We assist Board Members with all corporate compliance issues, including preparation of corporate filings with Federal, State, and local laws and codes. We work with and support the Association’s legal counsel in all civil, collection, and compliance proceedings. We assist in resolving community and neighbor complaints and concerns, work with the Board to implement community guidelines and rules, and enforce the Association’s governing documents. </p> 
               <p><em>Customer Service.</em> We provide 24/7 customer service to residents. We provide a ‘voice’ for residents to convey concerns to the Board, and we follow up on requests or concerns as directed by the Board.  </p>

               <h2>Finance FAQs </h2>
               <p><em>Why was I charged a late fee? </em>Assessment payments not received in full by the late fee date shown on your statement are subject to a late fee.<em>What are the most common reasons for a late fee? </em>Homeowners using their bank’s bill pay services are setting the payment date too late or do not include the HOA account number on the check. Homeowner mails their check to ASPM instead of the Seacoast Commerce P.O. Box. Homeowner is paying the old assessment amount. Homeowners owning multiple units are mailing one check for all units.<em>Can my late fee be reversed? </em>The Board needs to approve this request. Owners can submit a late fee reversal request in writing to the Association’s Community Manager by logging into your ASPM Client Account or by submitting a Customer Service Request. Requests are reviewed in your Association’s next scheduled Board Meeting. Any credit approved by the Board will be processed within ten business days. <em>When can I expect an approved refund?</em>Any refund approved by the Board will be processed within ten business days.</p>
               <p><em>How can I access my account information? </em>Homeowners can access information in their personal ASPM Client Account through the ASPM’s secure portal at aspm.cincwebaxis.com by going to Account Info, then My Profile. In your ASPM Client Account, you can: Access your account history and balance. Submit work orders and check on their status. Submit ACC Requests and check on their status. Access Association Calendars, Directories and Documents.<em>How can I update the names on my account?</em> Please send the updated name request with a copy of the current recorded deed to support the name changes on the account to:</p>

               <p><em>How can I update my mailing, phone or email address? </em>You may update your phone number, mailing, or email address in your personal ASPM Client Account accessible in your HOA’s secure portal by logging into <em>aspm.cincwebaxis.com</em>. Go to Account Info, then My Profile, update and save your changes.<em>Why didn’t I receive my statement?</em>Contact your HOA’s property manager to verify your account information is correct by logging into your HOA’s secure portal at <em>aspm.cincwebaxis.com</em> or by submitting a Customer Service Request.<em>How can I get a copy of my statement?</em>You may obtain a copy of your statement by contacting your HOA’s property manager by logging into your HOA’s secure portal at <em>aspm.cincwebaxis.com </em>or by submitting a Customer Service Request. Billing Statements are sent via email or US Postal mail on the 15th day of the month for the next month’s assessments. Unprocessed payments may not be reflected in the Statement balance. Remit payment for next month if the current month’s assessment has already been paid. Owners are encouraged to select paperless e-Statements in their web portal account settings to save you time and save the Association the cost of mailing statements.</p>
